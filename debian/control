Description: library for rendering SVG-based themes - development files
 Framework for rendering SVG-based themes with stylesheet re-coloring and
 on-disk caching.
 .
 KSvg provides both C++ classes and QtQuick components to render svgs based on
 image packs. Compared to plain QSvg, it caches the rendered images on disk
 with KImageCache, and can re-color properly crafted svg shapes that include
 internal stylesheets.
 .
 The default behavior is to re-color with the application palette, making it
 possible to create UI elements in SVG.
 .
 This package contains the development files for the Qt6 version of KSvg.
